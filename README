Description:

for each of the programs: ./program help=h  print small help.

cl_print - simple program to print result fo CL reduction 
           example: ./cl_print "S(K(SI))(S(KK)I)xy"

cl_bruteforce - program for search CL expression which generate a given result
                by brute force.                
		example: ./cl_bruteforce 010101010101010101010101 alphabet=SKI01 ignore=SKI

cl_ga - program for search CL expression which generate a give results
        by genetic algorithm.
	example: ./cl_ga 010101010101010101010101 alphabet=SKI01 ignore=SKI
	
rmdlga  --- implementations of R-Search
sspirme --- implementation  of SS'-Search
	
KNOWN BUGS:

We use recursive function for reduction. For some cl expressions we
can fast hit system stack size limit. You can ether decrease  number of
allowed reduction (" ./cl_print Yx max_steps=10000") ether increase
system stack size ("ulimit -s 100000000000" for linux)
